# Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration


I was super excited when watching *Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse*, especially scenes with the punk spider-man. The creators applied collage effect and layered up different pieces which turn the whole image to a comic collage.

I would love to try out comic collage effects with codes while we have already been introduced to turning our images into pixels. I would further research possible ways to turn our image into pieces. I also wish to utilize random generation and the pixels of the image into a pixel art animation in conjunction with a collage effect that boosts the contrast of different components of the image.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

Perlin noise in p5.js is the first function I landed on while researching. It is a common function for generative art. 

For creating the collage pieces, we could use mask function to draw a shape with image inside.
