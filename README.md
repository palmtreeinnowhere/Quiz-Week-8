# Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration


I was super excited when watching Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, especially scenes with the punk spider-man. The creators applied collage effect and layered up different pieces which turn the whole image to a comic collage.

I would love to try out comic collage effects with codes while we have already being introduced to turning our image to pixels. I would further research into possible ways for turning our image into pieces. If not, I would turn random generation and the pixels of the image into an pixel art animation.
